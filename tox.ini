# Run tests using:
#
#   HTTK_TEST_TYPE=<test type> tox
#
# Possible options for HTTK_TEST_TYPE are:
#
#   * all (default): the full test suite
#   * ci: a light set of tests suitable to run in CI
#   * pyver: just test that the tox and environment setup works
#          to test things with the intended python versions.
#          also: use this to refresh the Python environments in
#          .venv to match the spec in requirements.txt
#          (which then can be activated, e.g., as
#          source .venv/py39/bin/activate to use them for development)
