The high-throughput toolkit (httk)

A set of tools and utilities meant to help with:
   - Project management, preparation of large-scale computational project.
   - Execution of large-scale computational projects
        - interface with supercomputer cluster queuing systems, etc.
        - aid with scripting multi-stage runs
        - retrieval of data from supercomputers
   - Storage of data in databases
   - Search, retrieval and 'processing' of data in storage
   - Analysis (especially as a helpful interface against 3:rd party software)
