        A Structure represents N sites of, e.g., atoms or ions, in any periodic or non-periodic arrangement.

        This is a swiss-army-type constructor that allows a selection between a large number of optional arguments.

        To create a new structure, three primary components are:
           - cell: defines the basis vectors in which reduced coordinates are expressed, and the
                   unit of repetition (*if* the structure has any periodicity - see the 'periodicity' parameter)
           - assignments: a list of 'things' (atoms, ions, etc.) that goes on the sites in the structure
           - sites: a sensible representation of location / coordinates of the sites.

        Note: `rc_`-prefixes are consistently enforced for any quantity that would be different in a UnitcellStructure. This is to
        allow for painless change between the various structure-type objects without worrying about accidently using
        the wrong type of sites object.

        Input parameters:

           - ONE OF: 'cell'; 'basis', 'length_and_angles'; 'niggli_matrix'; 'metric'; all of: a,b,c, alpha, beta, gamma.
             (cell requires a Cell object or a very specific format, so unless you know what you are doing, use one of the others.)

           - ONE OF: 'assignments', 'atomic_numbers', 'occupancies'
             (assignments requires an Assignments object or a sequence.), occupations repeats similar site assignments as needed

           - ONE OF: 'rc_sites', 'rc_coords' (IF rc_occupations OR rc_counts are also given),
             'uc_coords' (IF uc_occupations OR uc_counts are also given)
             'rc_B_C', where B=reduced or cartesian, C=coordgroups, coords, or occupationscoords

             Notes:

                  - occupationscoords may differ from coords by *order*, since giving occupations as, e.g., ['H','O','H'] does not necessarily
                    have the same order of the coordinates as the format of counts+coords as (2,1), ['H','O'].

                  - rc_sites and uc_sites requires a Sites object or a very specific format, so unless you know what you are doing,
                    use one of the others.)

           - ONE OF: scale or volume:
                scale = multiply the basis vectors with this scaling factor,
                volume = the representative (conventional) cell volume (overrides 'scale' if both are given)
                volume_per_atom = cell volume / number of atoms

           - ONE OF periodicity or nonperiodic_vecs

        See help(Structure) for more information on the data format of all these data representations.
