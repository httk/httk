class UnitcellStructure(HttkObject):

    """
    A UnitcellStructure represents N sites of, e.g., atoms or ions, in any periodic or non-periodic arrangement.
    It keeps track of all the copies of the atoms within a unitcell.

    The structure object is meant to be immutable and assumes that no internal variables are changed after its creation.
    All methods that 'changes' the object creates and returns a new, updated, structure object.

    Naming conventions in httk.atomistic:

    For cells:
        cell = an abstract name for any reasonable representation of a 'cell' that defines
               the basis vectors used for representing the structure. When a 'cell' is returned,
               it is an object of type Cell

        basis = a 3x3 sequence-type with (in rows) the three basis vectors (for a periodic system, defining the unit cell, and defines the unit of repetition for the periodic dimensions)

        lengths_and_angles = (a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma): the basis vector lengths and angles

        niggli_matrix = ((v1*v1, v2*v2, v3*v3),(2*v2*v3, 2*v1*v3, 2*v2*v3)) where v1, v2, v3 are the vectors forming the basis

        metric = ((v1*v1,v1*v2,v1*v3),(v2*v1,v2*v2,v2*v3),(v3*v1,v3*v2,v3*v3))

    For sites:
        These following prefixes are used to describe types of site specifications:
            representative cell/rc = only representative atoms are given, which are then to be
            repeated by structure symmetry group to give all sites

            unit cell/uc = all atoms in unitcell

            reduced = coordinates given in cell vectors

            cartesian = coordinates given as direct cartesian coordinates

        sites = used as an abstract name for any sensible representation of a list of coordinates and a cell,
                when a 'sites' is returned, it is an object of type Sites

        counts = number of atoms of each type (one per entry in assignments)

        coordgroups = coordinates represented as a 3-level-list of coordinates, e.g.
        [[[0,0,0],[0.5,0.5,0.5]],[[0.25,0.25,0.25]]] where level-1 list = groups: one group for each equivalent atom

        counts and coords = one list with the number of atoms of each type (one per entry in assignments)
        and a 2-level list of coordinates.

    For assignments of atoms, etc. to sites:
        assignments = abstract name for any representation of assignment of atoms.
        When returned, will be object of type Assignment.

        atomic_numbers = a sequence of integers for the atomic number of each species

        occupations = a sequence where the assignments are *repeated* for each coordinate as needed
        (prefixed with uc or rc depending on which coordinates)

    For cell scaling:
        scaling = abstract name for any representation of cell scaling

        scale = multiply all basis vectors with this number

        volume = rescaling the cell such that it takes this volume

    For periodicity:
        periodicity = abstract name of a representation of periodicity

        pbc = 'periodic boundary conditions' = sequence of True and False for which basis vectors are periodic / non-periodic

        nonperiodic_vecs = integer, number of basis vectors, counted from the first, which are non-periodic

    For spacegroup:
        spacegroup = abstract name for any spacegroup representation. When returned, is of type Spacegroup.

        hall_symbol = specifically the hall_symbol string representation of the spacegroup

        A FullStructure represents N sites of, e.g., atoms or ions, in any periodic or non-periodic arrangement, where the positions
        of all cites are given (as opposed to a set of unique sites + symmetry operations).

        This is a swiss-army-type constructor that allows several different ways to create a FullStructure object.

        To create a new structure, three primary components are:

           - cell: defines the basis vectors in which reduced coordinates are expressed, and the
             unit of repetition (*if* the structure has any periodicity - see the 'periodicity' parameter)

           - assignments: a list of 'things' (atoms, ions, etc.) that goes on the sites in the structure

           - sites: a sensible representation of location / coordinates of the sites.

        Note: `uc_`-prefixes are consistently enforced for any quantity that would be different in a UniqueSitesStructure. This is to
        allow for painless change between the various structure-type objects without worrying about accidently using
        the wrong type of sites object.

        Note: see help(Structure) for parameter naming conventions, i.e., what type of object is expected given a parameter name.

        Input parameters:

           - ONE OF: 'uc_cell'; 'uc_basis', 'uc_length_and_angles'; 'uc_niggli_matrix'; 'uc_metric';
             all of: uc_a,uc_b,uc_c, uc_alpha, uc_beta, uc_gamma.
             (cell requires a Cell object or a very specific format, so unless you know what you are doing, use one of the others.)

           - ONE OF: 'uc_assignments', 'uc_atomic_numbers', 'uc_occupations'
             (uc_assignments requires an Assignments object or a sequence.), uc_occupations repeats similar site assignments as needed

           - ONE OF: 'uc_sites', 'uc_coords' (IF uc_occupations OR uc_counts are also given), or
             'uc_B_C', where B=reduced or cartesian, C=coordgroups, coords, or occupationscoords

             Notes:

                  - occupationscoords may differ from coords by *order*, since giving occupations as, e.g., ['H','O','H'] does not necessarily
                    have the same order of the coordinates as the format of counts+coords as (2,1), ['H','O'].

                  - uc_sites requires a Sites object or a python list on a very specific format, (so unless you know what you are doing,
                    use one of the others.)

           - ONE OF: uc_scale, uc_volume, or volume_per_atom:
                scale = multiply the basis vectors with this scaling factor,
                volume = the unit cell volume (overrides 'scale' if both are given)
                volume_per_atom = cell volume / number of atoms

           - ONE OF periodicity or nonperiodic_vecs
