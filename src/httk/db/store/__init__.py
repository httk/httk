Stores are abstract keepers of data. The only one properly implemented right now is sqlite, but others are possible.
Trivialstore stores data just in the python classes, and dictstore stores all data in a dictionary.

TODO: Note: since a few changes back I think neither trivialstore or dictstore currently works the way they should.
