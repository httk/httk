The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*)
====================================

This website documents the High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*). Looking for the Open Materials Database? It is at: http://openmaterialsdb.se

About the High-Throughput Toolkit
---------------------------------

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a toolkit for:

- Preparing and running calculations.
- Analyzing the results.
- Store the results and outcome in a global and/or in a personalized database.

*httk* is an independent implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)].
*httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic
structure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also outside those areas.

More info and help
------------------

For more details on installation options refer to :doc:`install`.
  
User's guide: see :doc:`users_guide`.

Workflows: for more details on how high-throughput computational workflows are
executed via the runmanager.sh program, see :doc:`runmanager_details`.
This may be useful if you plan to design your own workflows using *httk*.

Developing / contributing to *httk*: see :doc:`developers_guide`
