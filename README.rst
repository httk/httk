About the High-Throughput Toolkit
---------------------------------

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a toolkit for:

- Preparing and running calculations.
- Analyzing the results.
- Store the results and outcome in a global and/or in a personalized database.

*httk* is an independent implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)].
*httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic
structure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also outside those areas.

Quickstart
----------

Httk presently consists of a python library and a few programs. If you just want access to use (rather than develop)
the python library, and do not need the external programs, the install is very easy.

(Note: for *httk* version 2.0 we will go over to a single 'script' endpoint,
``httk``, for which the pip install step should be sufficient to get a full install.)


Install to access just the python library
*****************************************

1. You need Python 2.7 and access to pip in your terminal
   window. (You can get Python and pip, e.g., by installing the Python 2.7 version
   of Anaconda, https://www.anaconda.com/download, which should give you
   all you need on Linux, macOS and Windows.)

2. Issue in your terminal window::

     pip install httk 

   If you at a later point want to upgrade your installation, just
   issue::

     pip install httk --upgrade

You should now be able to simply do ``import httk`` in your python programs to use the *httk* python library.
     
Alternative install: python library + binaries + ability to develop *httk*
**************************************************************************

1. In addition to Python 2.7 and pip, you also need git.
   You can get git from here: https://git-scm.com/ 

2. Issue in your terminal window::

     git clone https://github.com/rartino/httk
     cd httk
     pip install --editable . --user

   If you at a later point want to upgrade your installation, just go
   back to the *httk* directory and issue::

     git pull
     pip install . --upgrade --user

3. To setup the paths to the *httk* programs you also need to run::

     source /path/to/httk/init.shell

   where ``/path/to/httk`` should be the path to where you downloaded
   *httk* in the steps above. To make this permanent, please add this
   line to your shell initialization script, e.g., ~/.bashrc

You are now ready to use *httk*.

  Notes:

  * The above instructions give you access to the latest stable release of httk.
    To get the latest developer relase (which may or may not work), issue::

	 git checkout devel
	 pip install . --upgrade --user

    in your httk directory. To switch back to the stable release, do::

	 git checkout master
	 pip install . --upgrade --user	
  
  * An alternative to installing with ``pip install`` is to just run httk out of the
    httk directory. In that case, skip the pip install step above and just append
    ``source ~/path/to/httk/init.shell`` to your shell init files,
    with ``~/path/to/httk`` replaced by the path of your httk directory.)*
  

  
A few simple usage examples
***************************

Load a cif file or poscar
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a very simple example of just loading a structure from a ``.cif`` file and writing out some information about it.

.. code:: python
     
  import httk
  
  struct = httk.load("example.cif")
  
  print("Formula:", struct.formula)
  print("Volume:", float(struct.uc_volume))
  print("Assignments:", struct.uc_formula_symbols)
  print("Counts:", struct.uc_counts )
  print("Coords:", struct.uc_reduced_coords)

Running this generates the output::

  ('Formula:', 'BO2Tl')
  ('Volume', 509.24213999999984)
  ('Assignments',['B', 'O', 'Tl'])
  ('Counts:', [8, 16, 8])
  ('Coords', FracVector(((1350,4550,4250) , ... , ,10000)))

..
  
Create structures in code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: python
	  
  from httk.atomistic import Structure
  
  cell = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0] ,
          [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] ,
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
  coordgroups = [[
                    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
                 ],[
                    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
                 ],[
                    [0.5, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.5]
                 ]]
		 
  assignments = ['Pb' ,'Ti' ,'O']
  volume =62.79
  struct = Structure.create(uc_cell = cell,
               uc_reduced_coordgroups = coordgroups,
               assignments = assignments,
               uc_volume = volume)
     

Create database file, store a structure in it, and retrive it
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: python

  import httk, httk.db
  from httk.atomistic import Structure

  backend = httk.db.backend.Sqlite('example.sqlite')
  store = httk.db.store.SqlStore(backend)

  tablesalt = httk.load('NaCl.cif')
  store.save(tablesalt)

  arsenic = httk.load('As.cif')
  store.save(arsenic)

  # Search for anything with Na
  search = store.searcher()
  search_struct = search.variable(Structure)
  search.add(search_struct.formula_symbols.is_in('Na'))

  search.output(search_struct, 'structure')

  for match, header in list(search):
      struct = match[0]
      print "Found structure", struct.formula, [str(struct.get_tags()[x]) for x in struct.get_tags()]



Create database file and store your own data in it
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. code:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python

  import httk, httk.db
  from httk.atomistic import Structure

  class StructureIsEdible(httk.HttkObject):

      @httk.httk_typed_init({'structure': Structure, 'is_edible': bool})
      def __init__(self, structure, is_edible):
	  self.structure = structure
	  self.is_edible = is_edible

  backend = httk.db.backend.Sqlite('example.sqlite')
  store = httk.db.store.SqlStore(backend)
  
  tablesalt = httk.load('NaCl.cif')
  edible = StructureIsEdible(tablesalt, True)
  store.save(edible)
  
  arsenic = httk.load('As.cif')  
  edible = StructureIsEdible(arsenic, False)
  store.save(edible)


	       
Tutorial
********
Under ``Tutorial/Step1, 2, ...`` in your *httk* directory you find a series of code snippets to run to see *httk* in action. 
You can either just execute them there, or try them out in, e.g., a Jupyter notebook.

In addition to the Tutorial, there is a lot of straightforward examples of various things that can be done with httk
in the ``Examples`` subdirectory. Check the source files for information about what the various examples does.


Reporting bugs
--------------

We track our bugs using the issue tracker at github. 
If you find a bug, please search to see if someone else
has reported it here:

  https://github.com/rartino/httk/issues

If you cannot find it already reported, please click the 'new issue' 
button and report the bug.

Citing *httk* in scientific works
---------------------------------

This is presently the preferred citation to the httk framework itself:

   The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk), R. Armiento et al., http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/.

Since *httk* can call upon many other pieces of software quite
transparently, it may not be initially obvious what other software
should be cited. Unless configured otherwise, *httk* prints out a list
of citations when the program ends. You should take note of those
citations and include them in your publications if relevant.
