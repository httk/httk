The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*)
====================================

This website documents the High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*). Looking for the Open Materials Database? It is at: http://openmaterialsdb.se

About the High-Throughput Toolkit
---------------------------------

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a toolkit for preparing and running calculations, analyzing the results, and store them in a global and/or in a personalized database. *httk* is an independent implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)]. *httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic structure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also outside those areas.
