   About the High-Throughput Toolkit
   ---------------------------------

   The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk) is a toolkit for preparing and
   running calculations, analyzing the results, and store them in a
   global and/or in a personalized database. httk is an independent
   implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
   pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. 
   [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)]. httk is presently targeted at
   atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic
   structure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also
   outside those areas.

Getting started with *httk*
---------------------------

Download
........

The latest download information for *httk* is found at
  http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/downloads.html

  
Installation
............
         
Installation information is found in the :doc:`install`.

User's guide
............

For information on basic usage of the *httk*, see :doc:`users_guide`.

More tricky details on how high-throughput computational tasks are executed via the runmanager.sh program are presented in :doc:`runmanager_details`. This is useful if you plan to write your own intricate run-scripts using *httk*.

Reporting bugs
--------------
Please report any bugs your find to our email (httk [at] openmaterialsdb.se (where [at] is replaced by @)

Presently known bugs will be listed in the *httk* erratum at
http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/erratum.html


Developing / contributing to *httk*
-----------------------------------

Read the :doc:`developers_guide`

Citing *httk* in scientific works
---------------------------------

This is presently the preferred citation to the httk framework itself::

  The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk), R. Armiento et al., http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/.

Since the *httk* can call upon many other pieces of software quite
transparently, it may not be initially obvious what other software
should be cited. Unless configured otherwise, *httk* prints out a list of citations when the program ends. You should take note of those citations and include
them in your publications if relevant.

Contributors
------------
