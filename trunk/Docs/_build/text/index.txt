The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*)
************************************

This website documents the High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*). Looking
for the Open Materials Database? It is at: http://openmaterialsdb.se


About the High-Throughput Toolkit
=================================

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a toolkit for preparing and
running calculations, analyzing the results, and store them in a
global and/or in a personalized database. *httk* is an independent
implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50,
2295 (2011)]. *httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations
in materials science and electronic structure, but aims to be extended
into a library useful also outside those areas.

About the High-Throughput Toolkit
---------------------------------

The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk) is a toolkit for preparing and
running calculations, analyzing the results, and store them in a
global and/or in a personalized database. httk is an independent
implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
pioneered by Ceder et al., and others.
[see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)]. httk is presently targeted at

Getting started with *httk*
===========================


Download
--------

The latest download information for *httk* is found at
   http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/downloads.html


Installation
------------

Installation information is found in the *httk Installation
Instructions*.


User's guide
------------

For information on basic usage of the *httk*, see *httk Users' Guide*.

More tricky details on how high-throughput computational tasks are
executed via the runmanager.sh program are presented in *httk
Runmanager Details*. This is useful if you plan to write your own
intricate run-scripts using *httk*.


Reporting bugs
==============

Please report any bugs your find to our email (httk [at]
openmaterialsdb.se (where [at] is replaced by @)

Presently known bugs will be listed in the *httk* erratum at
http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/erratum.html


Developing / contributing to *httk*
===================================

Read the *httk Developers' Guide*


Citing *httk* in scientific works
=================================

This is presently the preferred citation to the httk framework itself:

   The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk), R. Armiento et al., http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/.

Since the *httk* can call upon many other pieces of software quite
transparently, it may not be initially obvious what other software
should be cited. Unless configured otherwise, *httk* prints out a list
of citations when the program ends. You should take note of those
citations and include them in your publications if relevant.
