Latest version: v$HTTKVERSION

Jan 31, 2014: v0.4.1

  - handle httk.cfg sanely in svn (first make copies httk.cfg.default)
  - svntools/*.sh: a few scripts to help with command line svn
      (use svn_findnew.sh to list all files that are not in svn, except
       those in svn_exclude, use svn_finddelted.sh to find any files
       that has been removed.)
  - modification of a number of core database structures to make it 
    easier to provide straight out of the database floating point
    structure data needed for easy e.g. website visualization.
    (This was always the intention, only, upon actually implementing it
    a number of shortcomings was apparent.)
  - ability to manually supress citation printing on exit even if it
    is turned on in httk.cfg (fixes a bug in Templates/subvars.sh)
  - numpy now available via httk/external
  - fix of bug where structure -> db -> structure did not preserve hexhash
    (= rather extensive changes to db module)

Nov 25, 2013: v0.4, first externally released version

Current status:

  httk.core: FracVector is 'production ready', rest of core is beta quality code, 
     (but MutableFracVector is missing a crucial piece of code to allow actually changing elements)
  httk.db, httk.external, httk.iface: Alpha quality code, some part reasonably stable (e.g. DbStructure, etc.)
  httk.io. httk.tasks, httk.exe, httk.ctrl : Started, needs much more work
  httk.analysis: Not started
