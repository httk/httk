Latest version: v$HTTKVERSION


Nov 25, 2013: v0.4, first externally released version

Current status:

  httk.core: FracVector is 'production ready', rest of core is beta quality code, 
     (but MutableFracVector is missing a crucial piece of code to allow actually changing elements)
  httk.db, httk.external, httk.iface: Alpha quality code, some part reasonably stable (e.g. DbStructure, etc.)
  httk.io. httk.tasks, httk.exe, httk.ctrl : Started, needs much more work
  httk.analysis: Not started
