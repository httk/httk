The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk) v$HTTKVERSION

For License information see the file COPYING.
=================================================================================================

1. Place httk in some path of your system.

2. Edit httk.cfg to configure paths to other software that you want to use from httk. For programs (e.g., cif2cell) you want the path
   to point at the executable. For python libraries, you want the path setting to point at the directory you would
   include in PYTHONPATH, i.e., a directory that typically contains a subdirectory with the name of the package.

   If you don't have certain software, don't worry, just leave the line blank. If you have some libraries installed 
   in the system (e.g. 'import ase' works), then you can also leave the lines blank. If you want to make sure
   *not* to use system libraries, set allow_system_libs=no (this is useful if you are forced to work on a machine with a
   too old version installed in the system)
      
    You need ase and cif2cell for all the Example programs to work.

3. Read relevant parts of README.txt and run the Examples/ programs (they should work without any path adjustments)

4. If you want to be able to use httk just by 'import httk' from anywhere, add 
     export "PYTHONPATH=/path/to/httk:$PYTHONPATH"
   to the file .bashrc in your home directory. (Or the corresponding line to .tschrc if you use tcsh)

5. Read the rest of README.txt and contribute code :)
